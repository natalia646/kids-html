                    <h2 id="about-us"> About Rainbow Parties</h2>
                    <p class="about-us-text">The company was founded by three moms of little boys and girls aimed to
                        share
                        their experience of
                        throwing parties and make parents lives easier. Alice, Robin, and Lucy,
                        three founders of the company, had quite a journey planning parties for their children and faced
                        all
                        the possible complications and challenges. It was not an easy task, so in the end, they had to
                        figure out the easiest way
                        for parents to relax while kids are having fun and developed their own methods of planning,
                        organizing, and carrying out an original party for children.
                        That's how the idea for the Rainbow Parties was born. By figuring out innovative ways of
                        organizing
                        and planning kids' parties, our team helps parents save money without sacrificing
                        their kids' holiday experiences. This way, children's holidays can remain relaxing for the
                        entire
                        family. While our event-managers and chefs handle the fun part, parents are chilling, talking to
                        other parents, and just have a good time. </p>

                        generations, and
                        surprisingly, things haven't changed much. Of course, classics have to be neither boring nor
                        old-fashioned. At Rainbow Parties, we combine the eternal basics with new trends and
                        technologies, adapting
                        time-proven methods to the likes of the latest generation. Moreover, we will talk to your
                        kid to find out what's his or her interest are, so we can build up the main theme around topics
                        your child
                        cares about. </p>

                            for you. Usually, we prefer Card-to-Card transfers and PayPal transactions. We also use
                            Payoneer but
                            rather
                            as an exception than as a rule. And no, we do not accept crypto payments.
                            Another preferable option is cash during the face-to-face meeting. You can bring cash
                            with
                            you on the
                            first
                            consult so you can make the payment right after our meeting, without having to come to
                            the
                            office on
                            another
                            day.</p>
